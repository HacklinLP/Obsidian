I want to start making a game myself. It's just been something I've always wanted to do

I got recommended a **course on unity** so i really want to start learning that

For the idea of my game, I don't really know honestly
I've always been inspired by either cosy indie games like Stardew Valley or games Like Slay the Spire. I don't know why but there is just something about those games that i really like.
I think I'm gonna have a shot at making a turn based game if that's not hard in unity, otherwist i might just stick to a simple walking sim game or something similar to stardew valley.
